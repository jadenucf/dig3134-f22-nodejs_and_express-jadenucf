# Unit 2: NodeJS and Express

We will be expanding our skills by exploring both a new runtime environment, Node.js,
as well as a popular library. Along the way, we'll be learning more about the command
line and how servers handle networking requests from clients (such as browsers). This
unit is probably more advanced than anything you've done yet, and will solidify your
knowledge on topics ranging from files to ports and HTTP verbs.

As before, you'll be downloading and installing modules that aren't already included
from a zip file, which contains the files required for exercise, labs and tutorials.

## Modules

### Module 5: NodeJS, Command Line and File System

Node.js requires understanding important concepts relating to the operating system,
as Node.js both requires you to understand how processes execute as well as its
capabilities to read, manipulate and write files. In this module, you will explore
all three concepts together by writing your first command line program and emulating
the features of standard utilities included with all Linux distros. 

### Module 6: Express and Client-Server Interactions

This module introduces concepts relating to requests and responses through the
Node.js module express. Express is a popular package for building APIs that can form
the foundation for any website that requires a database or access to processes or
file system. We will be exploring different types of content and storage techniques
in the next unit on databases, but this module sets the foundation for interactions
with servers.
